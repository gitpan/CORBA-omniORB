CORBA::omniORB
==============

Perl Interface to omniORB


Status
======

Allmost all base client and server functionality is currently
working.  Quite a few things are left to be done. A few of 
them are:

 - wchar and wstring types
 - less frequently used ORB functions
 - ValueBase operations, Policy object and so on
 - IR object directly from ORB not from InterfaceRepository
 - ... :-)

None of these are particularly hard to do given what works
now - they just haven't been done yet.  See the TODO file for
a current list.


Documentation
=============

General information about a mapping of CORBA onto Perl is in
the available in the file 'omniORB/mapping.pod' while specifics
about omniORB are in 'omniORB.pm'. Information about the internals
of the module is in 'omniORB/internals.pod' These POD documents
can be viewed on the screen using the 'perldoc' program:

  perldoc omniORB/mapping.pod

or converted to a variety of formats, for example:

  pod2html omniORB/mapping.pod > omniORB/mapping.html

They will also be installed as manual pages.

The file omniORB/internals.ps is a diagram that may be useful
for figuring out omniORB/internals.pod.


Installation
============

To compile and run this package, you'll need to have omniORB 4.0.x
or better installed. Information about omniORB is availaible from:

   http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/

An interface repository implementation such as omniIFR is also needed:

   http://omniifr.sourceforge.net/

You'll also need Graham Barr's Error module (now maintained by Arun
Kumar U) - available from CPAN in the directory:

   http://search.cpan.org/~uarun/Error-0.15/

And a reasonable recent version of Perl. (This has been
tested with perl 5.8.x.)

Once you have these installed, to build this package, simply type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

The package then can be installed by executing the command:

  make install

See the README.win32 file in this directory for information on how to
build CORBA::omniORB for Win32 platforms.


Trying it Out
=============

Make sure the interface repository (omniifr) is started and that an
initial reference for the InterfaceRepository key is available using
the InitRef keyword of the omniORB.cfg file.  My InitRef setting looks
like this:

  InitRef = InterfaceRepository=corbaloc::localhost:11173/DefaultRepository
	  = NameService=corbaname::ns.example.com

Load the Account.idl file into the repository by running:

  omniidl -bifr Account.idl

Run the Perl server program in the background:

  perl -Mblib server &

And then run the client program:

  perl -Mblib client

You should see output that looks something like:
